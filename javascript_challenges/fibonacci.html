      // basic Syntax 
/*
      function F(n) if n = 0
      return 0 if n = 1
      return 1 else 
      return F(n-1) + F(n-2)

      Note : the term 0 of the sequence will be considered 0, so the first term will be 1; the second 1; the third,2 and so on.
      Let’s analyze the function for a moment. If it gets 0 as an input, it returns 0. If it gets 1, it returns 1. If it gets 2… Well, in that case it falls into the else statement, which will call the function again for terms 2–1 (1) and 2–2 (0). That will return 1 and 0, and the two results will be added, returning 1. Perfect.
      Now you can see why recursive functions are a problem in some cases. Imagine you wanted the 100th term of the sequence. The function would call itself for the 99th and the 98th, which would themselves call the function again for the 98th and 97th, and 97th and 96th terms…and so on. It would be really slow.
      But the good news is that it actually works!

    This is probably the first solution that will come to your mind. The important part here is that we calculate the next number by adding the current number to the old number.
And the good news is that has a O(n) time complexity. Fair enough for the first try right? But let’s try to see some other ways to approach the problem.
Recursive solution
Now let’s see if we can make it look fancier, now we will use recursion to do that.

function fibonacci_c(num){
    if(num <=1) return 1;

// Base case: we just need to check if the value is less than zero for return the 2 firsts cases.

/*
    But now the bad news… We have increased the time complexity of our algorithm almost to the worst case. If you take a look at the graphic, you will see the orange color (2^N) time complexity, which means that our current implementation is exponential…
    Memoization
Finally, and following the recursive approach we will use memoization to improve our efficiency, but first of all, what’s memoization? as Wikipedia says:
Is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls.
What does that means and why should we take care about that in our implementation? Basically, if we just store the value of each index in a hash, we will avoid the computational time of that value for the next N times.
This change will increase the space complexity of our new algorithm to O(n) but will dramatically decrease the time complexity to 2N which will resolve to linear time since 2 is a constant.
